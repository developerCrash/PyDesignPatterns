Creational Design Patterns
==========================

In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that help create objects in a way that's suitable for the situation. 
They can help reduce complexity and make the object instantiation process more flexible and efficient. 
Creational design patterns can be useful in scenarios where the nature of the object changes depending on the problem at hand.

Builder
Factory 
Prototype & Registry 


Structural Design Patterns
==========================

Structural design patterns are blueprints that show how to combine different objects and classes to form a larger structure that can achieve multiple goals. 
They are often used in large projects with many different classes and objects. Structural design patterns help to show how unique parts of a system can be combined in a flexible and extensible way. 
They also make it easier to understand the relationships between different classes.

Behavioural Design Patterns 
============================
Behavioral design patterns are a type of design pattern in software engineering that focus on how objects communicate and interact with each other in a system. 
These patterns define algorithms and assign responsibilities between objects, which can make communication easier and more flexible. 
They can also improve the flexibility and maintainability of code, and reduce complicated software design structures into simpler interconnections.
